        <h1>Grammar</h1>

        <p>The grammar of Jotisk is rooted in the North Sea Germanic (Ingvaeonic), with its historical background connected to Old Frisian, Old English, and Old Saxon, while also showing traces of Norse influence. Similarly to the case of English, Jotisk grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in Jotisk, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut or umlaut. Vestiges of the Germanic case and gender system are found in the pronoun system. Typical for an Indo-European language, Jotisk follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. </p>
